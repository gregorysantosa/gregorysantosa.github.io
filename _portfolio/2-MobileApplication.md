This Android app lets users explore artists and artworks using real-time data from the Artsy API. It's built with Java, Kotlin, and Jetpack Compose for a smooth and modern user interface. The app uses Retrofit to handle API calls and Coil to load images efficiently. PersistentCookieJar manages user sessions, while MongoDB is used on the backend to store user information like preferences or saved items. The project follows Android best practices with Lifecycle components and Material Design. If you wish to see the code for this project, send an email to [gsantosa@usc.edu](mailto:gsantosa@usc.edu).
