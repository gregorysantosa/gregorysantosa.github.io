This Full Stack Web Application lets users explore and search for artwork using real-time data from the Artsy API. The frontend is built with Angular, TypeScript, and Bootstrap to create a responsive and user-friendly interface. The backend uses Node.js and Express to handle server requests and connect to the API. MongoDB is used to store user information securely, enabling features like user accounts or saved preferences.
