A dedicated and detail-oriented software engineer, I earned my undergraduate degree in Computer Science from the University of California, Santa Cruz (UCSC), and am currently pursuing my graduate studies at the University of Southern California (USC). I have been working at the Naval Air Systems Command (NAVAIR) for two years, starting as a full-time employee and transitioning to a part-time role as I pursue my graduate studies. There, I contribute to mission-critical software solutions to support the fleet. With a strong foundation in software development and a passion for solving complex technical challenges, I aim to change the world with the real-world experience and academic knowledge my experiences have given me.
