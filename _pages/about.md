I am a software engineer and Computer Scientist from the Bay Area. I graduated with a degree in Computer Science from the University of California Santa Cruz, and I am currently working as a Computer Scientist with [Naval Air Systems Command](https://www.navair.navy.mil/) in Southern California. My experiences coding have mostly been focused on Computer Systems, Databases, and Artificial Intelligence. I believe that Software has the capability to positively impact lives and change the world.
