As of June 2023, I’ve officially graduated from the University of California, Santa Cruz with a Bachelor of Science in Computer Science, cum laude, with a GPA of 3.80. It’s a surreal moment—equal parts pride, relief, and reflection.

When I began in 2020, the world was uncertain. Classes were remote, campus life was paused, and I had no idea how things would unfold. What started in Zoom breakout rooms eventually evolved into late nights debugging in the lab, collaborating with brilliant peers, and pushing my limits through some truly challenging courses.

Over these three years, I immersed myself in everything from artificial intelligence and systems design to web development and database engineering. I wrote code that broke (often), then wrote better code. I wrestled with complexity, questioned assumptions, and learned to appreciate the beauty of elegant, efficient solutions.

But beyond academics, UCSC taught me how to think critically, how to ask the right questions, and how to stay persistent when nothing seems to work—skills I’ll carry long after any syntax is forgotten.

Now, I’m moving forward—bringing everything I’ve learned into the next phase: graduate study at the University of Southern California and a deeper dive into computer science. I’m excited to explore new areas, contribute to impactful projects, and continue growing as a technologist and problem solver.

Thank you to my professors, peers, and mentors who helped shape this journey. Here’s to what’s next.
