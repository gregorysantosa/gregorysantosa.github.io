-  Developed and optimized machine learning pipelines for signal-background discrimination in Higgs boson using large-scale datasets from the CERN experiment.
-  Applied supervised learning techniques to enhance event classification accuracy in proton-proton collision data.
-  Utilized NumPy, and pandas for data preprocessing, statistical analysis, and visualization of event-level characteristics and model outputs.
